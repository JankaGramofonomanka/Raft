# Raft

This is a solution to an assignment at my university course "distributed systems", 
to implement the raft algorithm.

A template for the solution to this assignment was provided, it contained definitions of traits, that the components of this system were supposed to implement. Thus my work consisted mostly of implementing these traits. Morover anything outside the solution folder was proveded with the template. See commit "Init project" to see the template.
